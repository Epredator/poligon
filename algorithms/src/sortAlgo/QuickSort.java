 *
 * Quick sort is another divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
 * This one works by recursively performing the following algorithm:
 1. Pick a pivot index and partition the array into two arrays.
 This is done using a random number in the sample code.
 While there are other strategies, I favored a simple approach for this sample.

 2. Put all values less than the pivot value to the left of the pivot point
 and the values above the pivot value to the right.
 The pivot point is now sorted—everything to the right is larger;
 everything to the left is smaller.
 The value at the pivot point is in its correct sorted location.

 3. Repeat the pivot and partition algorithm on the unsorted left and right partitions until every item is in its known sorted position.
